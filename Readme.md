# Ashark-bin
This repository was created for my own convinience. It contains some self-made binaries and scripts, which I often need every time I make a new linux installation or working with another pc.

I would like to have quick access to my bins, so I created this repo with some of them. Thereby I am also sharing them with you.

# How to use
If you want these files to be visible in terminal in every working directory, then just copy interested file to your _~/bin_ directory. This directory should be in your _$PATH_ variable.

Alternatively, you can just download interested script to any directory, make `chmod u+x` to it, and then launch using graphical environment or in the terminal.

# Detailed description
Some files will have documentation about their purpose and usage within them.

# Licence
Generally, if no explicit licence declaration exist in script, then consider it as WTFPL licenced.

[WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/) - Do what the fuck you want with my code.
